Algorithm:
 I have used online  morse code converter to the find the sceret key for the given MP3 FILE(MORSE CODE)
Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is a symmetric  encryption algorithm [WHICH IS  USED FOR FINDING  THE  Decrypted Output]
WHILE DECRYPTING I HAVE USED Encrypted Text(hoZyGgMHU4dM+8zgZAPXhA==),Secret Key used for Encryption(S3CR3TK3Y@123456) BY GIVING THIS I HAVE GOT THE ENCRYPTED OUTPUT  AS [algorithmissafe]
The Password to Unlock the PDF(Type the password in the report as “password is:algorithmissafe“)
The Secret code present in the Cyber Threat Advanced Machine Learning Algorithm PDF--S3CR3TK3Y@123456
